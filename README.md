# Sales Dataset RFM Analysis

This project focuses on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis using the Superstore Sales Dataset. `RFM_Analysis_Sales_Dataset.xlsx`

## Dataset Overview

The Sales Dataset, sourced from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting) (train.csv)

## MS-Excel Formulas Used

Utilized `PERCENTRANK.EXC` for Ranking R, F, M.

And various other formulas such as `VLOOKUP` and `IF`, as well as tools like `conditional formatting`, `pivot tables`, and `charts`.

## Significance of Segmentation

Segmenting R, F, M ranking on a scale of 0 to 9 and RFM score on a scale of 0 to 999 offers crucial ranularity
